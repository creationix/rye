# rye
A git based publishing platform implemented in lua

This is a work in progress.  The goal is to re-implement the [wheaty](https://github.com/creationix/wheaty) platform in lua.

So far it can render static sites directly from git repos on disk.

## Test it out!

You'll need [lit installed](https://github.com/luvit/lit#installing-lit) to test this.

 1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/creationix/rye.git`
 2. Run the setup script `cd rye && ./setup.sh`
 3. Run the program using lit `lit run`
